How to run this web application
-------------------------------
As of now, due to time constraints, I have not been able to deploy the web application on an Internet website. If I get the time, I will make sure to deploy it and send the URL on a follow up email.

In order to deploy the web application locally on your device, please install the necessary python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Once you have installed the necessary libraries, you may run the web application on your local computer by changing to the folder of the "replate" project and running:

python manage.py runserver

You may then click on the IP address provided in the Django output and open it in your web browser to access the web application.
